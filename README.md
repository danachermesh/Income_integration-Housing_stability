This study focuses on neighborhoods Income Integration level and its relationship with housing market stability, represented by rent burden, at the census tract level between 1990 and 2010. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to analyze the patterns of clustering and dispersing of the two criteria, income segregation and rent burden. A multivariate regression model had been developed to predict rent using income, income integration level and rental units number. We found that Income integration level is clustered among the city, so as rent burden.
